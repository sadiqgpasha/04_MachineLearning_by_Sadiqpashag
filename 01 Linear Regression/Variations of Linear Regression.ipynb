    "Quantile Regression is a type of regression analysis used to estimate the conditional quantiles of a response variable's distribution. Unlike traditional linear regression which estimates the mean of the dependent variable, quantile regression aims to estimate the median or other quantiles (e.g., 25th, 75th percentiles) of the dependent variable, providing a more comprehensive view of the relationship between variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "When to Use Quantile Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Non-Normal Distributions: When the data does not meet the assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Heteroscedasticity: When the variability of the response variable changes across levels of an independent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Robustness: When the data contains outliers or is skewed, quantile regression provides a more robust estimation of the central tendency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Detailed Analysis: When you want to understand the relationship between variables at different points in the distribution of the dependent variable (e.g., understanding how factors affect the lower, median, and upper quantiles of income).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have a dataset of test scores from students along with their study hours, and you want to understand how study hours impact different quantiles of the test scores distribution (e.g., the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles)."
